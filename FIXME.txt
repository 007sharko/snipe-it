X - remove Ziggy
X - and ziggy-js too
X - And what is /public/js/snipeit.js ? That looks like a generated file

The 'flash' (forced refresh/fake refresh) on uploads is dumb
X - the order on the uploaded files is wrong (backwards)
X - (fixed somehow?!) The Livewire.first() thing is still dumb (but Id o'nt know that we can fix it).

X - Deletes need to work (I got this working before using $.ajax; it's not even hard)

Then mapping and so on.

Can we potentially delete whatever that this.$http thing? Or is that some side-effect of Vue.js that we don't get for free? (yes, it was that)

I suspect the Alert section is not yet wired up - but should be. Doesn't seem too hard?
